REVIEW FROM LAST COURSE
object oriented programming has as it's main objective, arrange code in order to achieve faster execution
and better organize it's functions by using multiple objects, methods and attributes
an object is anything that possesses distinct methods and characteristics, they can also have a class
classes are labels to classify an object, many objects can be of the same class, but no object is the exact same
attributes are the characteristics of an object, methods are the funcions/actions of an object
encapsulation is the act of limiting methods and attributes inside a class, so only it can access it
inheritance is when a subclass can inherit the methods or attributes from it's mother class
public = anyone can access, private = limited access to specified objects
def is used to define a function, __init__ is usually used to initiate the first function in the object
polimorphism is when child class inherits the name, methods and attributes of the mother class, being able to be modified
